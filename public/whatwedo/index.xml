      <description>Time Series Data and Panel Data of Operations of Building and Engineering Systems such as a Water Treatment Plant, a Power Station, or a Pump Station, if being recorded and analyzed appropriately, will give engineers and managers a window of insightful pictures on
 Efficiency Reliability and Stability Correlation of variables Bottlenecks Risk factors and impacts  By understanding those, optimal decisions can be made. The tasks on data solutions and analytics can also be linked to Asset Management and Auditing tasks using the power of statistical correlation and prediction capacity, which could potentially save significant cost for asset&#39;s owners.</description>
